<h1> Fifodirs </h1>

<p>
 A <em>fifodir</em> is a rendez-vous point between the <em>notifier</em>
of certain events and its <em>listeners</em>. It is implemented via a
directory in the filesystem. No data is stored; it is appropriate to
create fifodirs in a RAM filesystem.
</p>

<h2> Manipulating fifodirs </h2>

<h3> C API </h3>

<h4> For the notifier </h4>

<ul>
 <li> You can create fifodirs via the
<tt>ftrigw_fifodir_create()</tt> function in
<a href="libs6/ftrigw.html">libftrig</a>. </li>
 <li> You can send an event to a fifodir via the
<tt>ftrigw_notify()</tt> function in the notifier part of the
<a href="libs6/ftrigw.html">libftrig</a>. </li>
 <li> You can clean up a fifodir via the
<tt>ftrigw_clean()</tt> function in
<a href="libs6/ftrigw.html">libftrig</a>. </li>
 <li> You can destroy fifodirs via the
<tt>rm_rf()</tt> function in
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/skalibs/doc/libstddjb/djbunix.html">libstddjb</a>. </li>
</ul>

<h4> For a listener </h4>

<ul>
 <li> You can subscribe to a fifodir via the <tt>ftrigr_subscribe()</tt>
function in the listener part of the <a href="libs6/ftrigr.html">libftrig</a>. </li>
 <li> Other functions in the <a href="libs6/ftrigr.html">libftrig</a> allow
you to receive and handle events synchronously or asynchronously. </li>
</ul>

<h3> Unix API </h3>

<h4> For the notifier </h4>

<ul>
 <li> You can create fifodirs with the
<a href="s6-mkfifodir.html">s6-mkfifodir</a> command. </li>
 <li> You can send an event to a fifodir with the
<a href="s6-ftrig-notify.html">s6-ftrig-notify</a> command. </li>
 <li> You can clean up a fifodir with the
<a href="s6-cleanfifodir.html">s6-cleanfifodir</a> command. </li>    
 <li> You can destroy fifodirs with the <tt>rm -rf</tt> command. </li>
</ul>  

<h4> For a listener </h4>

<ul>
 <li> You can subscribe to a fifodir and wait for an event, or a series
or events, with the
<a href="s6-ftrig-wait.html">s6-ftrig-wait</a> command. </li>
 <li> You can subscribe to a fifodir, then trigger a program, then
wait for an event, with the
<a href="s6-ftrig-listen1.html">s6-ftrig-listen1</a> and
<a href="s6-ftrig-listen.html">s6-ftrig-listen</a> commands. This
makes it possible to only send a notification after you're sure
a notifier is actually listening, in order to prevent race conditions. </li>
</ul>
    
<h2> Internals and Unix permissions </h2>

<ul>
 <li> Notifiers and listeners agree on a fifodir. </li>
 <li> The fifodir directory is created by the notifier. It must be writable
by listeners. </li>
 <li> To subscribe, a listener atomically creates a named pipe (FIFO) in this
directory and listens to the reading end. This named pipe must be writable
by the notifier. </li>
 <li> To send an event to listeners, the notifier writes the event byte to
all the named pipes in the directory. Credit for this idea goes to Stefan
Karrmann. </li>
 <li> To unsubscribe, a listener unlinks his named pipe from the directory. </li>
</ul>  

<p>
 Note that in the s6 implementation of fifodirs, there are a few additional
details: for instance, the named pipes created in a fifodir by a listener
follow a strict naming convention, for efficiency and safety reasons. If
you are using fifodirs, it is recommended that you use the provided C library
functions or the <tt>s6-ftrig-*</tt> command line utilities instead of
directly hacking into the fifodir internals.
</p>

<p>
Fifodirs are created by, so they always originally have the same uid and gid as,
their notifier. A notifier must be able to make his fifodir either publicly
accessible (anyone can subscribe) or restricted (only a given group can
subscribe).
</p> 

<p>
 A publicly accessible fifodir must have rights 1733: 
</p>

<ul>
 <li> Anyone can create a fifo in that fifodir </li>
 <li> Only the notifier can see all the subscribers' fifos </li>
 <li> A listener can only delete its own fifo </li>
 <li> A notifier can delete any fifo for cleaning purposes </li> 
</ul>

<p>
 A restricted fifodir must have the gid <em>g</em> of the group of allowed
listeners and have rights 3730. Unless the notifier is root, it
must be in the group of allowed listeners to be able to create
such a fifodir.
</p>

<ul>
 <li> Only members of <em>g</em> can create a fifo in that fifodir </li>
 <li> Only the notifier can see all the subscribers' fifos </li>
 <li> Fifos are always created with gid <em>g</em> </li>
 <li> A listener can only delete its own fifo </li>
 <li> A notifier can delete any fifo for cleaning purposes </li>
</ul>

<p>
 A named pipe in a fifodir must always belong to its listener and have
rights 0622:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> Only this listener can read on the fifo </li>
 <li> Anyone who has reading rights on the fifodir (i.e. only the notifier)
can write to the fifo </li>
</ul>

<p>
 The <a href="ftrig.html">libftrig<a/> interface takes care of all
the subtleties.
